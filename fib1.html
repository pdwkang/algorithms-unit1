Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

<script type="text/javascript">

var belowFourMil = true;
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
var temp = 0; 
var sum = 2;
// var temp = 0;
	
while(belowFourMil){
	temp = a + b;
	a = b; 
	b = temp;
	if(temp % 2 === 0){
		sum += temp};
	// console.log(c)
	if(temp > 4000000){belowFourMil = false}
}

console.log(sum)




</script>

a loop that keeps running until boolean.
inside the loop...
	add the previous number to the current number to get the new number
	once we have the new number, check to see if it's even.
	if it's even, throw it on the 'sum' pile.
